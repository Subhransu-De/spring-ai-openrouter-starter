# openrouter-spring-ai

[![Build](https://github.com/Subhransu-De/spring-ai-openrouter-starter/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Subhransu-De/spring-ai-openrouter-starter/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A native [Spring AI](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai) chat provider for
[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai). Instead of pointing the OpenAI client at OpenRouter's URL
and losing everything that makes OpenRouter distinct, this library models the OpenRouter surface
directly: model fallbacks, provider routing, cross-provider reasoning tokens, cost accounting,
and attribution headers — all behind the standard Spring AI `ChatModel` contract and
`spring.ai.openrouter.*` properties, built the same way Spring AI builds its official providers.

> **Community project:** This library is independently maintained and is not affiliated with,
> endorsed by, or an official project of OpenRouter or Spring AI.
>
> Install only one OpenRouter Spring AI starter in an application. Combining this starter with
> another OpenRouter starter can make provider selection and bean creation order-dependent.

Chat Completions is the production default. The optional Responses request mode is experimental;
applications should opt into it explicitly.

## Status

Done and live-verified:

- [x] Chat via OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible `POST /chat/completions` endpoint
- [x] Synchronous calls and SSE streaming
- [x] Tool calling via Spring AI 2.0's `ToolCallingAdvisor` on `ChatClient` (see below)
- [x] Streamed tool-call argument fragments (split by `index` across chunks) merged into
      complete tool calls
- [x] Reasoning options and reasoning-token surfacing (`openrouter.reasoning` metadata)
- [x] Usage accounting including cost, cached and reasoning tokens
- [x] Model fallback lists, provider routing preferences, service tiers
- [x] Spring Boot auto-configuration with full property binding
- [x] Observability: Micrometer `gen_ai.client.operation` observations for calls and streams
- [x] Embeddings via `POST /embeddings` behind Spring AI's `EmbeddingModel`
      (`spring.ai.openrouter.embedding.*` properties, provider routing included)
- [x] Image inputs: `UserMessage` media becomes `image_url` content parts (URLs pass
      through, byte-backed media is sent as base64 data URLs), in both chat-completions
      and responses mode
- [x] Image generation via OpenRouter's unified Image API (`POST /images`) behind Spring
      AI's `ImageModel`, including reference images, SSE partial-image streaming, and
      `spring.ai.openrouter.image.*` properties
- [x] Image generation via chat completions and responses mode
      (`modalities: ["image", "text"]` + `image_config`), with generated images surfaced as
      `AssistantMessage` media in sync and streaming responses

Planned:

- [ ] Typed DTO fields for currently skipped response data (`reasoning_details`, `logprobs`, …)
- [ ] The models catalogue endpoint
- [ ] OpenRouter server-side tools (web search plugin) and citation annotations
- [ ] Video, audio and PDF input modalities; text-to-speech and transcription

Module names, property prefixes, and layering deliberately mirror Spring AI's official
providers.

### Tool calling

Spring AI 2.0 moved the tool-execution loop out of the chat models and into
`ToolCallingAdvisor`, which runs in the `ChatClient` advisor chain. This library follows
that design exactly (as do Spring AI's own OpenAI and Anthropic models):

- **The model advertises and surfaces, never executes.** `OpenRouterChatModel` puts the
  tool definitions from your `ToolCallback`s on the wire and returns tool-call responses
  as-is (with a `TOOL_CALLS` finish reason), for both `call()` and `stream()`, in both
  chat-completions and responses mode. Your callbacks are never invoked by the model.
- **`ChatClient` + `ToolCallingAdvisor` runs the loop.** The advisor invokes your
  `ToolCallback`s, appends the results to the conversation, and calls the provider again
  until a final answer arrives — for calls and streams alike. `ChatClient`
  auto-registers the advisor by default, so `ChatClient.builder(chatModel).build()` is
  enough; opt out per request with
  `advisors(AdvisorParams.toolCallingAdvisorAutoRegister(false))` to surface tool calls
  without executing them.

Register tools on the request options (or the `ChatClient`), not as model default
options: the advisor executes with the options it sees on the prompt. Tools declared only
by bean name are resolved through the `ToolCallbackResolver` configured on the
`ToolCallingManager` during execution.

### Embeddings

`OpenRouterEmbeddingModel` is auto-configured next to the chat model and implements Spring
AI's `EmbeddingModel`, so it plugs into vector stores and RAG advisors unchanged:

```yaml
spring:
  ai:
    model:
      embedding: openrouter
    openrouter:
      api-key: ${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}
      embedding:
        model: openai/text-embedding-3-small
        dimensions: 256 # optional, model-dependent
```

```java
float[] vector = embeddingModel.embed("The quick brown fox");
```

Provider routing (`spring.ai.openrouter.embedding.provider.*`) works the same way as for
chat. Only `float` embeddings are decoded; requesting `encoding_format: base64` fails fast.

### Image inputs

Attach image media to a `UserMessage` and it is sent as OpenRouter `image_url` content
parts. Plain URLs pass through; classpath/byte resources are inlined as base64 data URLs:

```java
UserMessage message = UserMessage.builder()
    .text("What is in this image?")
    .media(Media.builder()
        .mimeType(MimeTypeUtils.IMAGE_PNG)
        .data(URI.create("https://example.com/cat.png"))
        .build())
    .build();
```

Non-image media (video, audio, PDF) is rejected explicitly for now rather than silently
dropped; those modalities are on the roadmap.

### Image generation

`OpenRouterImageModel` implements Spring AI's `ImageModel` over OpenRouter's unified
Image API (`POST /images`):

```yaml
spring:
  ai:
    model:
      image: openrouter
    openrouter:
      api-key: ${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}
      image:
        model: bytedance-seed/seedream-4.5
        aspect-ratio: "16:9"
        quality: high
        output-format: webp
```

```java
ImageResponse response = imageModel.call(new ImagePrompt("a red panda wearing sunglasses"));
String base64 = response.getResult().getOutput().getB64Json();
```

The OpenRouter-native knobs (`resolution`, `aspect-ratio`, `quality`, `output-format`,
`background`, `output-compression`, `seed`) are available on `OpenRouterImageOptions`,
along with `inputReferences` for image-to-image work and `providerOptions` passthrough.
`OpenRouterImageModel.stream(ImagePrompt)` exposes OpenRouter's SSE image streaming:
partial previews arrive first (see `OpenRouterImageGenerationMetadata.partialImageIndex()`),
then the completed image with usage and cost.

Image-capable _chat_ models work too: set
`OpenRouterChatOptions.builder().modalities(List.of("image", "text"))` (optionally with
`imageConfig`) and generated images arrive as `AssistantMessage` media — in sync calls
and streams alike, in both chat-completions and responses request modes.

### Observability

The starter includes Spring AI's standard observation auto-configuration for chat,
embedding, and image models. OpenRouter model calls emit `gen_ai.client.operation`
observations with the `openrouter` provider, operation, request model, response model
where available, and token-usage context. When a `MeterRegistry` is present, chat and
embedding usage is also recorded as `gen_ai.client.token.usage`.

The starter provides the Spring AI handlers, but it does not choose monitoring backends
for the application:

- Metrics require a `MeterRegistry`. Spring Boot Actuator supplies the Boot observation
  wiring and a registry; add the registry/exporter for your monitoring system to publish
  them externally.
- Traces require a Micrometer `Tracer` bridge and tracing exporter.
- Prompt, completion, image-prompt, and error logging are opt-in through Spring AI's
  standard properties. Content logging does not require an exporter; when a `Tracer` is
  present its handlers become tracing-aware, and error logging requires that tracer.

```yaml
spring:
  ai:
    chat:
      observations:
        log-prompt: false
        log-completion: false
        include-error-logging: false
    image:
      observations:
        log-prompt: false
```

Enabling content logging can expose sensitive prompt or model output data. Applications
may supply their own model observation handlers or
`ChatModelObservationConvention`, `EmbeddingModelObservationConvention`, and
`ImageModelObservationConvention` beans. Boot backs off a standard handler when the
application supplies the same handler type, and the OpenRouter models use the custom
conventions.

## The Garage demo

[`openrouter-spring-ai-samples`](openrouter-spring-ai-samples) is a small story: a garage
foreman model inspects a customer's car, delegates one job to a specialist model, and writes a
service record. A normal run stays easy to read; `--full` turns it into a capability tour across
OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible chat-completions format. Together they exercise system and user
messages, sync chat, streaming, tool calling with mixed parameter schemas, real file I/O side
effects, model-to-model delegation, model fallback lists, provider routing preferences, service
tier, reasoning options, usage and cost metadata, and request metadata. Its modality bays cover
the non-chat surfaces: an embeddings triage matcher, a digital inspection bay that reads a
bundled dashboard photo (image input, both request modes), and a paint bay that generates
images through the Image API (sync and streaming) and chat-completions modalities.

It doubles as the library's live test harness. With `--auto`, the run asserts its own structural
outcome (service record written, every required tool actually invoked, usage metadata present,
non-empty final answer, and streaming signals when requested) and fails loudly otherwise — these
assertions have caught real bugs that the model's confident prose hid, like tools being silently
dropped from requests or streamed images blowing the default SSE codec limit. Every live
finding becomes a replayable unit test.

```bash
mvn -pl openrouter-spring-ai-samples package
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=$(cat openrouter.key) java -jar openrouter-spring-ai-samples/target/*.jar \
    --topic="1987 diesel pickup, hard cold starts" --full --auto
```

Each run writes `capability-report.md`, `garage-run.json`, and `run.json` evidence.

## Maven and Gradle builds

Maven and Gradle build the same three published thin library JARs. Versions and BOM
baselines come from the root Maven POM, and CI builds and tests both build systems across the
supported Java versions. The executable samples application is intentionally separate.
